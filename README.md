Second Exercise

This Repo is meant to cover the Second Excersice for the testing test. Technologies used:

NighwatchJS - FrameWork for End to End testing -https://nightwatchjs.org/
Selenium WebDriver
Request - Simplified HTTP client - for API Transactions

NightWatchJS has proved to be one of the main tools to achieve testing coverage from my past experience. The implemented Design Pattern was Page Object Model (POM) aiming at scalability and maintainability for future reference. Some features I implemented are screenshots and easy to understand output on test results. There are many improvement areas if this is meant to be implemented on production not done here due to time constraints, some of them are: Integration with CI/CD tools such as travis,  Implementing an abstraction layer to ease BDD such as Gherkin, Parameterized API calls, Enhanced Reporting and Include a Data file to handle the data layer for tests.
